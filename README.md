## About The Game

This "game" is a *passion project* by **1 person**
*( Probably why it has slow updates )*

And is purely *python code*!
*( May move to another programming language )*

You can explore the map and do tasks that ~~**GOD**~~ tell you!
It's in its **ALPHA** stage now, frequent updates happen in the source code

The source code will be the frequent patches, while releases can send some massive Hotfixes.

As I said it is still in **ALPHA**, changes may range from little to *bug fixes*, to fundamental aspects of the game that may or may not be morally questionable.

I plan to move this to Lua and maybe recreate it in Love2D.

## How to play

**EAT!!1!**
You can eat meat, apples, and water.
Meat focuses on Health more.
Apple is an inbetween.
And water is more stamina focused.

**DO YOUR TASKS!!1!**
*** will punish you if you don't
The punishment will be severe.
You can heal up after the tasks though...

**EXPLORE! COLLECT!**
I'll revamp the map later! I swear!
You can collect some food.
And other things...
