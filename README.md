## About The Game
This "game" is a *passion project* by **1 person**
*( Probably why it has slow updates )*

And is purely *python code*!
*( May move to another programming language )*

You can explore the map and do tasks that ~~**GOD**~~ tell you!
It's in its **ALPHA** stage now, frequent updates happen in the *Rolling-release* branch.

This main branch is for **ACTUAL UPDATES** and not patches for little things you might not worry about, though major patches happen when the Rolling-Release branch has *important bugs* that needs to be fixed.

As I said it is still in **ALPHA**, changes may range from little to *bug fixes*, to fundamental aspects of the game that may or may not be morally questionable.

## How to play
**Do your *tasks*!**
In version v0.1.0-alpha this doesn't matter if you go through the day without ever doing the task or Sleep/Wait through the whole day.
( It's a demo for your sake. )

**Sleep to *heal yourself*!**
Though in version v0.1.0-alpha you can't even die, but hey atleast you can't do it anymore in v0.2.0-alpha.

## Q&A
1. Will you hurry up with the updates?
> "I'm REALLY busy, no seriously I am."
2. Why?
> "I'd rather not say it"
3. Why is some bugs/features there or not?
> "It's in alpha, though if you want fixes you should go to Rolling-Releases"
4. When are you gonna release/finalize it?
> "After version v0.6.0-beta"
5. Do you have a roadmap?
> "Yes, and no. Yes because I made on, and no because I'll focus on bug-fixes/play-testing."
