## About The Game

This "game" is a *passion project* by **1 person**
*( Probably why it has slow updates )*

And is purely *python code*!
*( May move to another programming language )*

You can explore the map and do tasks that ~~**GOD**~~ tell you!
It's in its **ALPHA** stage now, frequent updates happen in the source code

The source code will be the frequent patches, while releases can send some massive Hotfixes.

As I said it is still in **ALPHA**, changes may range from little to *bug fixes*, to fundamental aspects of the game that may or may not be morally questionable.

I plan to move this to Lua and maybe recreate it in Love2D.

## How to play

**EAT!!1!**
You can eat meat, apples, and water.
Meat focuses on Health more.
Apple is an inbetween.
And water is more stamina focused.

**DO YOUR TASKS!!1!**
*** will punish you if you don't
The punishment will be severe.
You can heal up after the tasks though...

**EXPLORE! COLLECT!**
I'll revamp the map later! I swear!
You can collect some food.
And other things...

## Features coming up

## ANOUNCEMENTS

After v0.3.0-alpha releases, I will halt commits.
And start learning C, since I have to spread my programming knowledge.
Though I promise it won't be long. I SWEAR I'm not losing passion

v0.4.0 Onwards will be beta. and up until v0.6.0 will be almost release.
All features are gravitating towards bug fixes and patches until then.

Hope you have a good year!
